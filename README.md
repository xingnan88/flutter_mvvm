# Flutter MVVM Boilerplate

This repository contains a boilerplate project structured around the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for Flutter development.

## Introduction

The purpose of this boilerplate is to provide a standard template for building Flutter applications with a clear separation of concerns using the MVVM pattern. This helps in creating scalable, testable, and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- MVVM Architecture
- Dependency Injection
- Example Widgets and ViewModels
- Unit and Widget Tests
